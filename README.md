# GEE
This repository covers the google earth engine code from satellite image processing to GEE web app development

## SMCI
A calculation google earth engine code of SMCI (soil moisture condition index) as for the soil moisture dataset of SMAP.

## Check seed germination
This GEE code determines about the seed germination of crop whether it is germinated or not in the given farm field. It also provides the date on which the crop seed is failed.

## Crop calendar 
This GEE code shos the crop calendar in graphical form for a selected field based. This code plot the time-series of NDVI from sentinel -2 , thereafter linear trend is computed to detrend the series. This is followed by the harmonic smoothning of NDVI time series. Now, we can determinte the sown and harvested time of crop field by noticing the dip in the curve.

## Crop Map
The crop map for Dibrugarh district, Assam is generated using multi-date opical and microwave sentinel data of Rabi season. Random forest machine learning algorithm is used to generate the crop map.

## Forest Fire impact analysis
This google earth engine code is generated to deteremine the forest fire impact of Bijrani forest range, Nainital for the year 2021. 

## Multi Point extraction
This google earth engine code executes the extraction of selected bands and indices values from sentinel 2 imagery for the given points.

## Know Your Cloud
This GEE web app visualize the sentinel 2 RGB images in ascending order of cloud percentage for selected date range and region with its date info
